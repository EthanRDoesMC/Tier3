Sort of. \r\n\r\nThe AwesomeTeam (EthanRDoesMC bit.ly/EthanRDoesMC KKFay, Jnoble1, Wnoble4, SweetAssassin123) and a few friends have banded together to revive this mod. It takes a large chunk of the story (and characters) and gives it an AwesomeTeam twist. \r\n\r\nEarliest release date: 2018\r\n\r\nBETAS AND DEMOS WILL COME YOUR WAY\r\n\r\n-The AwesomeTeam \r\n\r\n</info>",
