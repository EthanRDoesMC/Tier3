# Tier3Revival
The revival of Tier 3!

In 2012, a promising mod for Portal 2 called Tier 3 was cancelled unexpectedly. Nothing has been heard from it since. 
Until now. Sort of. 

The AwesomeTeam (EthanRDoesMC bit.ly/EthanRDoesMC KKFay, Jnoble1, Wnoble4, SweetAssassin123) and a few friends have banded together to revive this mod. It takes a large chunk of the story (and characters) and gives it an AwesomeTeam twist. 

Earliest release date: 2018

BETAS AND DEMOS WILL COME YOUR WAY
